                    <h3>Web Application Security</h3>
                    <p>Web application security (also known as Web AppSec) is
                        the idea of building websites to function as expected,
                        even when they are under attack. The concept involves a
                        collection of security controls engineered into a Web
                        application to protect its assets from potentially
                        malicious agents. Web applications, like all software,
                        inevitably contain defects.</p>

                    <h3>Cloud Security</h3>
                    <p>Cloud security involves the procedures and technology
                        that secure cloud computing environments against both
                        external and insider cybersecurity threats. Cloud
                        computing, which is the delivery of information
                        technology services over the internet, has become a must
                        for businesses and governments seeking to accelerate
                        innovation and collaboration. </p>

                    <h3>Cyber Threat Intelligence</h3>
                    <p>Threat intelligence is data that is collected, processed,
                        and analyzed to understand a threat actor’s motives,
                        targets, and attack behaviors. Threat intelligence
                        enables us to make faster, more informed, data-backed
                        security decisions and change their behavior from
                        reactive to proactive in the fight against threat
                        actors.</p>

                    <h3>Incident Response</h3>
                    <p>Incident response (IR) is a set of information security
                        policies and procedures that you can use to identify,
                        contain, and eliminate cyberattacks. The goal of
                        incident response is to enable an organization to
                        quickly detect and halt attacks, minimizing damage and
                        preventing future attacks of the same type.</p>

                        organization's information security management system
                        (ISMS) aligns with the most recent information security
                        best practices, as defined by ISO/IEC 27001:2013

                        of technologies, devices and processes. In its simplest
                        term, it is a set of rules and configurations designed
                        to protect the integrity, confidentiality and
                        accessibility of computer networks and data using both
                        software and hardware technologies.</p>
