2. Counting the number of characters
Create a program that prompts for an input string and displays output that shows the input string and the number of characters the string contains.

Initialize  text to null
Initialize the textLength to 0

Prompt “Please write down a script and then I calculate the character count”
Validate the user input. If valid, assign the text to text variable and take the white spaces out. Else, prompt “Please write a valid text”.

Count the number of characters in the text and assign it to textLength.

Display “Your text is” + text + “and your text has” + textLength + “characters”
